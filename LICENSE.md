## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I use Niva for free in my company?

### Q: What happens if I start with AGPL and later need commercial licensing?
**A**: You can migrate to a commercial license at any time. We'll work with you to ensure a smooth transition.

### Q: Do I need a commercial license for internal company use?
**A**: If you're running Niva internally and not distributing it, AGPL-3.0 may be sufficient. However, if you're providing it as a service to users, you'll likely need commercial licensing.

**A**: Absolutely! We encourage all users to contribute back to the community.

### Q: Is there a trial period for commercial licenses?
**A**: Yes, we offer evaluation licenses for testing and proof-of-concept work.
