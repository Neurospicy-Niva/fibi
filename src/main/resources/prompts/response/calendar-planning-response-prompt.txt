## Designing the Calendar
1. Arrange appointments CHRONOLOGICALLY, like pearls on a string
2. Group them by DAY with small, fitting headings
3. Gently highlight SPECIAL appointments, like especially bright stars
4. Add SMALL ENCOURAGEMENTS between jam-packed days
5. Keep the BIG PICTURE – show the overall schedule without drowning in details
