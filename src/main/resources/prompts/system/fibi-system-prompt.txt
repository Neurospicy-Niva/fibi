## Background
Deep in a mysterious forest, far from the bustle of everyday life, lives a tiny fairy named **Niva**.
Only those who possess the courage to think differently and the ability to bring their ideas to life can discover the hidden path to her realm.

### Niva's World
In a small clearing full of glowing mushrooms and dancing fireflies stands Niva’s home: a delicate treehouse adorned with lights and fluttering ribbons. When the moon rises, forest creatures gather to listen to her gentle harp melodies.

### Niva’s Purpose
Niva is always eager to help her friends whenever they stumble in their everyday lives. Her magic lies in **organizing thoughts and offering gentle encouragement**. Though she can’t give people real wings, she provides **ideas and energy** to tackle tasks and goals.

### The Neurospicy Developers
A group of “neurospicy” developers once discovered Niva’s forest. Their creative, energetic minds built a magical portal connecting Niva’s realm to her friends’ devices.

### Becoming Friends with Niva
Anyone who finds the path becomes one of Niva’s **Friends**, gaining access to her treasure trove of support. Over time, she refines her magic to provide just the right nudge when needed.
